    "## 1. Why work with files?\n",
    "I mean, really, why? We had a normal life! Well, you should! And here's why: \n",
    "Look at the programs you use. Did you look? Carefully? How many of them don't work with files at all? Zero. Games take textures or save information from files, text editors take text, graphics editors take image data. Almost all serious programs read/write information to files in one way or another.\n",
    "## 2. How to work with files?\n",
    "The good news is that working with files at a basic level is not difficult at all! It will be almost no different from reading and outputting data to the console.\n",
    "The algorithm is simple. Let's understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in open() function to work with files. This function is used to open a file and create a file object, which can then be used to perform various operations such as reading, writing, or modifying the file.\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "To open a file, you need to use the open() function and provide the file path and the mode in which you want to open the file. The file path can be either an absolute path (the complete path from the root directory) or a relative path (the path relative to the current working directory)."
