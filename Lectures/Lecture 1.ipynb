    "**What is Jupyter Notebook?**\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, and narrative text. It's widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and other computational tasks, especially in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Highly interactive\n",
    "- Excellent for data analysis and exploration\n",
    "- Facilitates creating reports and documentation alongside your code\n",
    "- Enables fast prototyping\n",
    "- Produces visual outputs seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Collaboration can be challenging\n",
    "- Versioning and code reviews are not straightforward\n",
    "\n",
