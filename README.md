### Creating training materials to teach programming from scratch

As part of the work done, extensive tutorials covering various aspects of the Python programming language have been created. The lectures include a complete introduction to the basics of the language, from explaining basic concepts such as dynamic typing and variables to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming and creating chat-bot in Telegram. The bilingual lecture materials can be found in the respective folders.

Yandex.Contest problem sets have also been developed for practical application of the concepts learned. These tasks allow students to practice programming by applying the acquired knowledge in practice, which contributes to a deeper assimilation of the material.
